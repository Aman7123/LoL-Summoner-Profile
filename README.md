# LoL-Summoner-Profile
A GUI project I made for my CIS 314 class. The point of the assignment was to call an online API for some JSON data and to process and 
display that info to the user. My assignment accessed the Riot Games API servers to obtain data about a player.

My software is written as an example of something you can do in school or for fun and should't be released and require a payment to use.
